This is a side-scroller style space-shooter minigame created on Greenfoot and programmed in Java. For those unfamiliar with Greenfoot, it's a free software provided by Oracle specifically designed for programming 2D video games. I created this project to use as a demo for a course I taught, as well as brush up on my own knowledge. To play, head to https://www.greenfoot.org/scenarios/29074. Optionally, you can also download Greenfoot along with my Greenfoot project file included in this repository.
